The purpose of this repository is to show the differences between the structure of a [feature-folder](https://github.com/chimon2000/react-architecture/tree/main/feature-app) application and a [feature-sliced design](https://github.com/chimon2000/react-architecture/tree/main/fsd-app) application.

Specific differences to callout
- Uniformity: code in FSD is organized by scope of influence (layers), by domain (slices), and by technical purpose (segments).
- Controlled reuse of logic: in FSD, each architectural component has its purpose and predictable dependencies.
